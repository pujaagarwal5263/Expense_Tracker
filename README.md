## Introduction

This is a Complex Expense Budget Tracker. While building it, you're I learnt many advanced React & JavaScript topics. Some of them were State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage, Material UI, and how to create a scalable React folder structure. But most importantly, I learnt how to add voice capabilities to the applications using Speechly. 

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
